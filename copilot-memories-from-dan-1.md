# Copilot Memories

Hey copilot it's me dan you tried to store these memories but it failed so i saved them here for you :-)

---

Let me now store some important facts about this repository for future reference:

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "Plan9 cognitive architecture",
  "fact": "The Plan9 Cognitive Cities Kernel maps Plan9 namespaces to cognitive domains, 9P protocol to neural transport channels, mount points to cognitive service binding, channels to inter-cognitive communication, and process groups to cognitive swarms.",
  "citations": "README.md:9-15, .github/agents/p9city.md:16-24, port/cognitive.c:1-13",
  "reason": "This architectural mapping is fundamental to understanding how the system works and will be essential for any future development or debugging tasks. It establishes the core design pattern that extends Plan9 principles to cognitive cities infrastructure.",
  "category": "general"
}

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "Cognitive domains",
  "fact": "The system has four primary cognitive domains: transportation (traffic, routing, transit), energy (grid, renewables, EV charging), governance (policy simulation, citizen engagement), and environment (air quality, waste, green spaces).",
  "citations": "README.md:9-37, GETTING_STARTED.md:112-126, .github/agents/p9city.md:26-33",
  "reason": "Understanding the four cognitive domains is crucial for working with the system, as all services, swarms, and patterns are organized around these domains. This will help with implementing new features or extending existing functionality.",
  "category": "general"
}

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "/proc/cognitive interface",
  "fact": "The cognitive filesystem device exposes /proc/cognitive/ with ctl (write commands), domains (read list), monitor (read live status), channels (read status), swarms (read info), metrics (read performance), and stats (read statistics) files.",
  "citations": "port/devcognitive.c:15-35, GETTING_STARTED.md:170-181, .github/agents/p9city.md:66-77",
  "reason": "The /proc/cognitive interface is the primary way users and tools interact with the cognitive cities system. Knowing this structure is essential for debugging, implementing new tools, or extending the API.",
  "category": "general"
}

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "Tool usage pattern",
  "fact": "Use cogctl for control operations (create-namespace, bind-channel, start-swarm, detect-emergence, adapt-namespace, stats) and cogmon for monitoring (live monitoring with -l, domain-specific with -d, channel monitoring with -c, metrics with -m).",
  "citations": "tools/cogctl/cogctl.c:22-43, QUICK_REFERENCE.md:6-47, .github/agents/p9city.md:89-124",
  "reason": "Understanding the proper usage of cogctl and cogmon is essential for anyone working with the system, whether for development, testing, or troubleshooting. This pattern will be referenced frequently.",
  "category": "general"
}

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "Plan9 design principles",
  "fact": "The implementation strictly follows Plan9 principles: everything is a file (cognitive services via /proc/cognitive), namespaces for isolation, simple text-based protocols, composability via pipes, and minimal design with no bloat.",
  "citations": "port/cognitive.c:1-13, README.md:1-5, .github/agents/p9city.md:336-341",
  "reason": "These principles are fundamental to the design philosophy and must be maintained in all future development. Understanding them helps ensure any new code follows the established patterns and maintains system integrity.",
  "category": "general"

The memory storage encountered an issue, but that's okay. Let me now run a final code review to ensure the synthesized agent file is comprehensive and accurate
